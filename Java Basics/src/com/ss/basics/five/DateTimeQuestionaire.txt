1) Which class would you use to store your birthday in years, months, days, seconds, and nanoseconds?
I would use a LocalDate object to store the date and time of my birthday. 

2) Given a random date, how would you find the date of the previous Thursday?
use the function getDayOfWeek() and get getDayofMonth(). Day of week will give a enum of Sun - Saturday. 
We can use this to subtract the value on getDayofMonth() to find the date of the previous Thursday.

3) What is the difference between a ZoneId and a ZoneOffset?
ZoneId talks about your local Zone (Example PDT/EST). ZoneOffset checks the difference between our local zone and UTC.

4) How would you convert an Instant to a ZonedDateTime? How would you convert a ZonedDateTime to an Instant?
you can use a toInstant() to change a ZonedDateTime to an instant. 
You can use atZone(<Zone Location>) to change a zone to an instant.
